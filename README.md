# WebCrawler-using-java

## This web crawler crawls the cse.uta.edu website and does the following:  
1. Gets all links and recursively call the processPage method (BFS traversal)
2. Goes to only those links that have faculty and doesn't start with mailto: and length<150 and is not a pdf link. It ignores already visited link. 
3. Stores unique traversed links in database and constructs an N-ary tree from the links traversed.  
4. It doesnot crawl to the www.uta.edu as a requirement. www.uta.edu is the parent of cse.uta.edu

## Working on to find the diameter of the N-ary tree generated by web crawling and inbound and outbound links for each link.
